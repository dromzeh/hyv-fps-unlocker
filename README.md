# hyv-fps-unlocker

Lightweight program for Windows that allows you to modify the FPS of **Honkai Impact 3rd** and **Honkai: Star Rail** by changing registry values.

Read the blog post about this project (For Hi3 unlocking) [here](https://dromzeh.dev/posts/hi3-fps-unlock/).

> **Note**:
> Because you're modifying the registry, changing your options in-game **will overwrite the fps to the value you set in-game. To change the fps again, you will have to re-run the program.**

> **Warning**:
> **I am not responsible for any consequences that may occur from using this program.** Use at your own risk.
