# hi3-fps-unlocker

Program that allows you to modify the fps of Hi3 in and outside of levels to any value of your choice.
Read the blog post about this project [here](https://dromzeh.dev/posts/hi3-fps-unlock/).

> **Note**:
> Because you're modifying the registry, changing your options in-game will overwrite the fps to the value you set in-game. To change the fps again, you will have to re-run the program.
